Welcome to my site!

My name is Nathaniel Mantell, and I've have been working on various software projects for over 7 years now, and have been programming as a hobby since I was 13.

Over the years I have picked up many skills and tricks, with intrapersonal skills always underlying the most important lessons I have learned.

I naturally gravitated towards product management and product management, as I have a natural talent for conveying complex technical ideas to non-technical and business focuses people.

I love bridging the gap between teams, crafting process to fit the needs and preferences of each unique client or team, and using visual technique to communicate effectively across competencies and across borders.

I have worked with developers in-house and remotely, collaborating with talent from the United States, Brazil, India, Russia and the Ukraine.

I currently am partnered with Wordpress, Magento and Python/Django developers, and skilled graphic designers and front end devs versed in React, Vue.js and Ionic.

In addition to my experience with design and product/project management methods employing tools such as Jira, Figma, Invision, and Photoshop, I personally write code in React and Python/Django. I also program games in Unity!

If you have any web or mobile project you would like to see come to life, contact me and I'll assemble a team of talent to make it happen.

Cheers!
